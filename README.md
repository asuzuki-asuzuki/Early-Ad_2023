# Early-Ad_2023
In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing and multi-layered analysis of early and advanced lung adenocarcinoma. We especially focused on multi-omics features in very early adenocarcinoma cases which are classified by Noguchi classification to understand key molecular events during cancer progression in very early stages. We analyzed a total of 76 non-small cell lung cancer cases including 48 very early adenocarcinomas.
